## Project 1. AI-Omics Lab (Purdue University)
**Scientific Data Engineering & Backend Validation**

### Context
- AI-Omics research team (Advisor: Dr. W. Andy Tao)
- Disease biomarker ML research using high-resolution mass spectrometry data

### Problem
- Large-scale scientific data with different structures by experiment
- ML model training is not possible without validated data
- Reproducibility is a core constraint in research

### My Contribution (Core Work)
- Backend data pipeline (Python): file I/O, modular code design, exception handling
- Automated experimental data verification using rule-based validation logic
- Standardized data structures prior to ML training through scientific data processing
- Collaboration: understanding a Django-based backend structure
- Collaboration using Git/GitHub (feature branching, rebase)

### Output
- Designed and implemented backend validation logic to ensure the integrity of mass spectrometry data
- Enabled a stable preprocessing pipeline and improved reproducibility of AI-based omics research

### Skills Used
- Python (Core, backend logic)
- Django, data validation
- Git/GitHub, collaborative development

### Why It Matters
- Learned that ensuring data reliability before modeling is one of the most important data science competencies in real-world research environments

## Project 2. University Hospital Limerick (Ireland)
**Healthcare & Epidemiological Data Analytics**

### Context
- Analysis of over 15 years of healthcare data
- Comparative analysis across 33 EU countries

### Problem
- Heterogeneous healthcare data structures across countries and regions
- Required interpretation from a public health perspective rather than simple statistics

### My Contribution
- Data wrangling and integration using tidyverse (dplyr, tidyr, forcats)
- Epidemiological analysis using age standardization and age-standardized death rates (ASDR)
- Disease classification based on ICD-10 codes
- Geospatial and interactive analytics using sf, leaflet, and giscoR
- Dashboard development using Plotly and Crosstalk

### Reproducible Research
- Quarto-based analytical reports

### Output
- Time-series and map visualizations of hospitalization and mortality rates for selected EU countries
- Supported researchers’ data accessibility and decision-making

### Skills Used
- R, tidyverse
- Epidemiology
- GIS
- Dashboarding

### Why It Matters
- Converted complex healthcare data into accessible formats
- Enabled cross-country comparisons of healthcare indicators using a consistent standard
- Provided dashboards that directly support research and decision-making
